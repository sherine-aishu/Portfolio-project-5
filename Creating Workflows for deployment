Github worflows are used for CI/CD. Workflows here are used for deployment automation starting from building images , pushing it to hub and pulling images on production server and starting our container where the application is served.

# WF1 is for build and push 
In repository, create a new file .github/workflows/wf1.yml

.yml

here, 
      Authentication to dockerhub from github repository is essential. So the username and password of dockerhub account is going to be stored as secrets in github
      settings --> secret --> actions --> new repo secret
      DOC_USERNAME put in your username 
      DOC_PASSWORD put in your password

# WF2 is for pull and run
In repository, create a new file .github/workflows/wf2.yml

.yml

here, 
      WF2 will contain an IP. This IP needs to be replaced by the IP of your production server.
      Pulling image into production server is basically a command executed on production servers by github actions. So github requires access to ssh into the production servers. Below process will let you know how to setup ssh authentication.

# Set up authentication in GitHub to access our production servers
Login to server as ec2-user
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com”
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 id_rsa

Copy the private key and paste it in the secret variable created as mentioned below
settings --> secret --> actions --> new repo secret
PRIVATE_KEY put in your privatekey

If you receive permission denied error while authentication, then we need to try and validate the ssh key from our local machine
scp -i 'keypair.pem' ec2-user@prodpubip:/home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa .
ssh -i id_rsa ec2-user@prodpubip
here,
      If the authentication is successful, then issue is with secret that you saved.
      If the authentication is not successful, then its the issue with the keypair and its permissions.


Step 7c: Now GitHub wf 2 will be able to login to prod server to perform any acton , i.e pull and run container n images

Create pull req to master to trigger the wf

Both wf success
