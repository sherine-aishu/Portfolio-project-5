In our production host, before pulling images we need to make sure the servers are pre configured to avoid any discrepencies.

# SG configuration
In your EC2 security configuration make sure port 80 is opened.

#Install docker
yum install docker -y
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker

# Enable firewalld
yum install firewalld -y
systemctl status firewalld
systemctl start firewalld
systemctl enable firewalld

# Open port 80 for system level connectivity
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
sudo systemctl reload firewalld
